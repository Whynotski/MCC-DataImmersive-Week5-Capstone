# MCC-DataImmersive-Week5-Capstone
Capstone project with Kiran and Leo

For this group assignment, you will need to put together a start-to-finish data project that explores an issue/problem/point of improvement, and present to the audience insights that supports it. The following guidelines should be addressed as you work on your project:

1. Identify the scenario. Your scenario should include an issue, problem, point of improvement, or action you want to take (for example, in the Kickstarter project, the company needed to identify the "best" crowdsourcing campaigns to market in order to make more money if the client succeeded in meeting their campaign goals). 

2. Identify the audience. Who are you presenting to? This structures the type of content you use in your presentation. Is your audience more technical? Or are they everyday people that you need to talk to in general terms? (for the Kickstarter project, the audience was the marketing executives, so they did not speak in technical terms but wanted solid information on what will make them money and the main reason why it will make them money)

3. Identify the outcome/takeaway. What do you want your audience to do once you give them your insights? What kind of action do they need to do? (Kickstarter example: The outcome was to have the marketing department direct their efforts to pursuing potential clients that fit into the demographic identified. To use one group's takeaway, Priester Marketing should target amateur videographers from Nigeria that post on YouTube because the African film industry is growing substantially).

Technical Guidelines:

Your group should use a predictive model to identify the scenario of if a new data point were introduced (Kickstarter example: If a new potential client were proposed to the managers, how likely are they to be successful, according to the predictive model? Then using the results, make a decision on if the company should take on the client).
All content for your presentation should be hosted on a website (i.e., Jupyter notebook on Github, Tableau visualizations on Tableau Public, AWS content, Google slides, etc.) and submit the URL(s) for this assignment. If your group plans to use a PowerPoint for your presentation, also submit the file here.
